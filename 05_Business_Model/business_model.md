## 🌱 Growth Levers

- Viral emotional feedback: users share AI-generated encouragement screenshots on social media
- Low-friction onboarding: "just talk to your app" lowers barrier to adoption
- Cultural expansion: localized versions for regional food/workout styles (e.g., East Asia, Mediterranean, South Asia)

## 🧩 Strategic Positioning

> "We’re not competing with MyFitnessPal on database size — we’re redefining what a health app feels like."

Our value isn’t in raw features. It’s in:
- Emotional retention, not just daily streaks  
- Zero-friction input, not rigid logs  
- Intelligence that *learns you*, not lectures you

This is a new category: **Emotionally-Aware Health AI.**
