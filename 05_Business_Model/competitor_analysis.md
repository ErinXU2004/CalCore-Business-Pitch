## 🧠 Strategic Insight

Most health apps focus on **tracking**. CalCore focuses on **empathy + intelligence**.

- Where others see a log entry, we see a story.  
- Where others show a chart, we offer encouragement.

CalCore isn’t just another app. It’s a companion that fits modern, diverse, emotionally complex lives — not the rigid mold of ideal fitness.

> In short: **we’re not building a better tracker. We’re building a more human experience.**
