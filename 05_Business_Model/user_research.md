## 👥 Interview-Based Insights

Through informal interviews and discussions with target users (students, young professionals, health-curious individuals), we’ve gathered key themes:

### 1. **Logging Fatigue is Real**
- “I start strong for 3 days, then I forget or get bored.”
- “If I miss one day, I feel like I failed — so I stop altogether.”

### 2. **Most Apps Feel Cold and Mechanical**
- “It just gives numbers. I know the numbers. I need help sticking with it.”
- “I wish it would say something nice when I do well… or at least acknowledge when I’m trying.”

### 3. **Emotional Triggers Often Drive Behavior**
- “I eat out of stress, then feel guilty, then stop tracking.”
- “I want an app that supports me, not just scores me.”

### 4. **Lifestyle & Culture Aren’t Reflected in Existing Apps**
- “I'm not a gym person. I dance.”
- “My meals don’t fit into Western food categories.”

## 🧩 Product Design Implications

- ✅ Focus on **empathy-first AI responses**, especially during failure moments  
- ✅ Minimize friction: remove guilt triggers, allow flexible input

- ✅ Turn data into **meaning**, not just statistics
