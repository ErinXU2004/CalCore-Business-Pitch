## 🎯 Target Users

CalCore is designed for people who want to manage their health without friction, shame, or generic plans. Our core user groups include:

- 🧑‍💼 **Busy professionals and students** juggling work, study, and life pressures — they need intuitive, low-effort tools that reduce cognitive load, not add to it.
- 🧘‍♀️ **Health-conscious individuals who dislike traditional apps**, especially those frustrated by manual input, cold interfaces, and rigid tracking styles.
- 💬 **Users seeking motivation and emotional support**, not just numbers. People who want to feel seen, understood, and encouraged in their journey.
- 🍽️ **People with unique eating habits or cultural styles** — whether it's one meal a day, liquid-focused diets, or non-standard timing. CalCore respects individual choices rather than enforcing standard meal templates.
- 🌍 **Users with geographic or lifestyle constraints** that limit access to typical workouts or meals — for example, people living in food deserts, shift workers, or those with irregular schedules.

> CalCore is built for humans with real lives, not robots with perfect routines.
